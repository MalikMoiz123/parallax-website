      <h2>Northern Areas</h2>
      <p>
        The Northern Areas are the most spectacular and fascinating region of
        Pakistan. The three world’s famous mountain ranges meet here — the
        Himalayas, the Karakorams and the Hindukush. The historic Karakoram Pass
        (5,575 meters), an ancient trading route between the Northern Pakistan
        and Xinjiang, China, gives its name to the range, which forms the
        watershed between the Indus and the Central Asian deserts.

      <h2>GILGIT</h2>
      <p>
        Situated at an elevation of 1,454 metres along the banks of Gilgit
        River, a quaint little town of Gilgit has spectacular scenic beauty. For
        centuries, it had been the capital of various dynasties. Its history
        goes well beyond the 6th century AD. What to see? Gilgit Bridge is a
        bridge over the fast-flowing Gilgit River. This is one of the largest
        suspension bridges in South Asia (182 metres long and 2 metres wide)
        allowing enough space for one jeep at a time to cross. A beautiful
        standing Buddha figure (locally known as «Yashini») is carved on a rock
        near KargahNullah), 10 km from Gilgit town. It dates back to the 7th
        century AD. Remains of a Buddhist monastery and stupas of the 6th
        century AD were discovered in 1938 and 1956 near Nurpur. There are also
        ancient rock carvings of animals near the Karakorum University and
        inscriptions near Danyore. Built in 1962, Independence Monument is a
        tribute to the heroes of the liberation movement of 1947–48. A victory
        monument of Taj Mughal, built 700 years ago, as a reminder of Taj-ud-Din
        Mughal, a ruler who came to Gilgit Baltistan during the 13th century,
        AD, is 30 km jeep drive from Gilgit town. Sher Qila (Lion’s Fort),
        situated 38 km west of Gilgit, was once the capital of the ancient
        Kingdom of Punial. It has a polo ground, an old carved wooden mosque and
        a 150-year-old watchtower, crowned with a pair of Ibex horns. Gahkuch
        Headquarters of Ghizer District is an ideal place for trekking, fishing
        and duck shooting. Yasin, the main town of the Yasin Valley, 112 km west
        of Gilgit, is located at the altitude of 2,750 m above sea level. People
        of Yasin speak Brushisky and Khowar languages. Until the 20th century,
        Yasin was an important kingdom controlling the shortest and easiest
        route between the Oxus and the Indus rivers.

      <h2>BALTISTAN SKARDU</h2>
      <p>
        Skardu is the capital of Baltistan. The Balti people are a mixture of
        Tibetan and Caucasian stock and speak Balti, an ancient form of Tibetan.
        Due to the similarity of its culture, lifestyle and architecture with
        Tibet, Baltistan is also known as the «Tibet-e-Khurd» (Little Tibet).
        The tourist season in Baltistan lasts from April to October. The maximum
        temperature here is 27 °C and minimum — in October -8 °C. The five
        valleys of Baltistan — Shigar, Skardu, Khaplu, Rondu and Kharmang — are
        famous for their luscious peaches, apricots, apples, and pears. What to
        see? Kharpocho Fort — is an ancient Fort in Skardu. It was constructed
        by Ali Sher Khan Anchan, who ruled over Baltistan till the end of the
        16th century. Buddha Rock Carvings date back to the 8th century AD. It
        is a huge Buddha figure surrounded by small Buddhisatvas located three
        km from Skardu. Mountain lakes — Upper Kachura, Lower Kachura and
        Sadpara Lake — are very famous for fishing and boating. Shigar Valley is
        the gateway to the great mountain peaks of the Karakorams, Gasherbrum
        and K-2. Khaplu Valley is a beautiful valley of the Shyok River 103 km
        east of Skardu. Khaplu is the starting point for most of the trekking
        and climbing expeditions. Many famous mountains such as Masherbrum,
        Saltoro, SiaKangri, K-6, and K-7 are located here. Chaqchan Mosque is
        one of the earliest mosques in Baltistan (1504 AD), attributed to Syed
        Ali Hamdani. There is a Palace of Raja of Khaplu and remains of
        Thorsikhar Fort.
